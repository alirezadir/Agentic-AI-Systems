# Use Case Examples

This directory contains complete, real-world agentic applications. Each subfolder is a self-contained project demonstrating how to build and deploy generative AI solutions for specific domains or workflows.

## Top AI Agent Use Cases in 2025:

- **Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
  - Remains a leading enterprise GenAI use case.
  - Next-generation agentic RAGs enhance retrieval and are widely adopted.
  - Notable enterprise solutions: Perplexity AI (B2B), Sonar API, Glean AI.

- **Voice Agents**
  - Identified as a major trend by a16z research.
  - Automate sales calls and customer support with complex, multi-step processes.
  - Key players: ElevenLabs, VAPI, 11x Retell AI.

- **Computer-Using Agents (CUA)**
  - **Major trend in 2025**: Vision-language models enabling agents to interact with computer interfaces like humans
  - Gaining traction with multi-agent workflows and generalist capabilities
  - Leverage agentic APIs and vision-language models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5+)
  - **Key Players:**
    - **OpenAI's Operator**: Powered by Computer-Using Agent (CUA), combining GPT-4o's vision with advanced reasoning through reinforcement learning
    - **OpenCUA**: Open-source framework for transparent research into computer-use agents (August 2025)
    - **Microsoft Fara-7B**: Efficient agentic model for computer use, leveraging computer interfaces for task automation
    - **Anthropic's Computer Use**: Claude-based computer-using capabilities
    - **Other platforms**: Manus AI, Genspark Superagent, ChatGPT Agent (with managed browser sandbox)
  - **Use Cases**: Web automation, GUI interaction, software testing, workflow automation

- **Coding Agents**
  - Experiencing rapid adoption as companies seek to boost developer productivity.
  - Notable solutions: Cursor AI ($200M ARR), open-source Cline and Roo Code (10k+ GitHub stars).

- **Tool-Based Agents**
  - Specialized agents that use specific tools to achieve targeted outcomes.
  - Serve niche but critical market needs.
  - Examples: Clay’s agent, Breeze (Hubspot AI Agent).

- **Workflow Automation Agents**
  - Extend low-code/no-code automation platforms with advanced agentic features.
  - Enable users with minimal technical background to build AI agents.
  - Leading platforms: N8N (drag-and-drop), Flowise (open-source).
