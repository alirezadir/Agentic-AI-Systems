# Utils

This directory contains shared utility modules and helper functions used across multiple projects in this repository.

## Modules
[coming soon!]
<!-- - `memory.py`: Memory implementations for agents (e.g., conversation, retrieval, etc.)

Feel free to add your own utilities here to support new projects.  -->
