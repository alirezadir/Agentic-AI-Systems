### 3. [`/Code`](./Code/) (🚧 Coming Soon)
Hands-on starter code, examples, and small projects to accelerate your understanding and development of agentic systems.

<!-- | Resource | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🛠️ *Starter Templates* | Minimal codebases to bootstrap agentic systems using OpenAI, Anthropic, and LlamaIndex. |
| 🧪 *Experiments & Workflows* | Sample pipelines for task planning, multi-agent interaction, retrieval-augmented reasoning, and more. |
| 🎯 *Mini-Projects* | End-to-end demos integrating agents with external tools, APIs, or web interfaces. |
| 💡 *Design Patterns in Code* | Common system architecture patterns (e.g. planner-executor, tool-user agents). | -->

> 🔜 *Coming soon — contributions welcome!* You can start by forking and submitting your own code-based experiments.
