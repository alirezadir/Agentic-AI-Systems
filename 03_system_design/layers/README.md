# Layers

**Updated 2025**: This page provides detailed overviews of layers in agentic AI systems, including the comprehensive layer stack for production-ready architectures.

**2025 Context**: Layer architectures have been standardized with clear separation of concerns: Perception, Cognition, Action, Memory, Orchestration, and Governance layers. Modern systems implement these layers with modular, extensible designs.

## Key Layer Categories

- **Perception Layer**: Input processing, feature extraction, intent classification
- **Cognition Layer**: Reasoning, planning, decision-making
- **Action Layer**: Tool execution, API integration, system interaction
- **Memory Layer**: Short-term, long-term, and working memory management
- **Orchestration Layer**: Multi-agent coordination, workflow management
- **Governance Layer**: Safety, guardrails, compliance, responsible AI

See [Agentic Architecture Layers](../architectures/agentic-arch-layers.md) for the complete 13-layer production stack.
