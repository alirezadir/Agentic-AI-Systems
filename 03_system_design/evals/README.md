# Evaluating Agentic AI Systems 

This page provides an overview of evaluation methods in agentic AI systems, including the latest frameworks, benchmarks, and tools available in 2025.

Evaluating AI agents is essential for building robust and effective agentic applications. Due to their complex architecture, it is important to assess different aspects of agent performance using targeted metrics and tools.

**Evaluation Landscape in 2025:**
- Evaluation has matured into a standardized practice with well-defined testing frameworks
- Multiple specialized benchmarks available for different agent capabilities (web agents, OS agents, tool-using agents)
- New evaluation tools and platforms have emerged for production-scale agent testing
- Focus on real-world scenarios and non-deterministic testing approaches

This guide outlines key categories and metrics to consider when evaluating AI agents. Not all metrics will be relevant for every use case—choose those that best align with your project goals.
