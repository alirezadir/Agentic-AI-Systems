Here's how to evaluate your AI Agents...

Evaluating AI agents is crucial for building effective agentic applications.

Given their complex architecture, different aspects require specific metrics and tools for evaluation.

Letâ€™s dive into key metrics to track:

ðŸ“Œ Technical Performance (For Engineers):

Track how efficiently your agents handle tasks at the technical level:

â†³ Latency per Tool Call
- Measures the time taken for tool interactions

â†³ API Call Frequency
- Tracks the number of external API calls

â†³ Context Window Utilization
- Examines how well LLMs manage their context.

â†³ LLM Call Error Rate
- Evaluates the frequency of failures in model responses to address issues like limits or misaligned prompts.

ðŸ“Œ Cost and Resource Optimization (For Business Leaders)

Evaluate cost efficiency and resource usage to ensure scalability:

â†³ Total Task Completion Time
- Tracks the overall time required for task completion, highlighting bottlenecks

â†³ Cost per Task Completion
- Measures financial resources spent per task

â†³ Token Usage per Interaction
- Monitors token consumption to optimize payloads and lower costs

ðŸ“Œ Output Quality (For Quality Assurance Teams)

Ensure the outputs generated meet the required standards:

â†³ Instruction Adherence
- Validates compliance with task specifications to reduce errors.

â†³ Hallucination Rate
- How often an AI generates incorrect, irrelevant, or nonsensical outputs.

â†³ Output Format Success Rate
- Ensures the structure of outputs (e.g., JSON, CSV) is accurate, preventing compatibility

â†³ Context Adherence
- Assesses if responses align with input context

ðŸ“Œ Usability and Effectiveness (For Product Owners)

Measure how well your agents meet user needs and achieve goals.

â†³ Agent Success Rate
- Tracks the percentage of Agentic tasks completed successfully.

â†³ Event Recall Accuracy
- Measures the accuracy of the agent's episodic memory recall

â†³ Agent Wait Time
- Measures the time an agent waits for a task, tool, or resource.

â†³ Task Completion Rate
- Monitors the ratio of tasks started versus completed.

â†³ Steps per Task
- Counts steps needed for task completion, highlighting inefficiencies.

â†³ Number of Human Requests
- Measures the frequency of user intervention to address gaps in automation.

â†³ Tool Selection Accuracy
- Assesses if agents choose appropriate tools for tasks.

â†³ Tool Argument Accuracy
- Validates the correctness of tool input parameters.

â†³ Tool Failure Rate
- Monitors tool failures to identify and fix unreliable components.

Note: Not all metrics are necessary for every use case. 

Select those aligned with your specific objectives.
