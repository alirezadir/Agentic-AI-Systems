## Evaluating AI Agents: A Practical Guide

Evaluating AI agents is essential for building robust and effective agentic applications. Due to their complex architecture, it is important to assess different aspects of agent performance using targeted metrics and tools.

This guide outlines key categories and metrics to consider when evaluating AI agents. Not all metrics will be relevant for every use caseâ€”choose those that best align with your project goals.


### 1. Technical Performance (For Engineers)

Assess how efficiently your agents handle tasks at a technical level.

- **Latency per Tool Call**  
  Measures the time taken for each tool interaction.

- **API Call Frequency**  
  Tracks the number of external API calls made by the agent.

- **Context Window Utilization**  
  Examines how effectively large language models (LLMs) manage their available context.

- **LLM Call Error Rate**  
  Evaluates the frequency of failures in model responses, helping to identify issues such as prompt misalignment or system limits.

### 2. Cost and Resource Optimization (For Business Stakeholders)

Evaluate the cost efficiency and resource usage of your agents to ensure scalability.

- **Total Task Completion Time**  
  Tracks the overall time required to complete a task, highlighting potential bottlenecks.

- **Cost per Task Completion**  
  Measures the financial resources spent on completing each task.

- **Token Usage per Interaction**  
  Monitors the number of tokens consumed, which can help optimize payloads and reduce costs.



### 3. Output Quality (For Quality Assurance)

Ensure that the outputs generated by your agents meet the required standards.

- **Instruction Adherence**  
  Validates whether outputs comply with task specifications.

- **Hallucination Rate**  
  Measures how often the agent generates incorrect, irrelevant, or nonsensical outputs.

- **Output Format Success Rate**  
  Checks if the structure of outputs (such as JSON or CSV) is accurate and compatible with downstream systems.

- **Context Adherence**  
  Assesses whether responses are consistent with the provided input context.



### 4. Usability and Effectiveness (For Product Owners)

Measure how well your agents meet user needs and achieve intended goals.

- **Agent Success Rate**  
  Tracks the percentage of agentic tasks completed successfully.

- **Event Recall Accuracy**  
  Measures the accuracy of the agent's episodic memory or recall of past events.

- **Agent Wait Time**  
  Records the time an agent spends waiting for a task, tool, or resource.

- **Task Completion Rate**  
  Monitors the ratio of tasks started versus those completed.

- **Steps per Task**  
  Counts the number of steps required to complete a task, helping to identify inefficiencies.

- **Number of Human Requests**  
  Measures how often user intervention is required, indicating gaps in automation.

- **Tool Selection Accuracy**  
  Assesses whether agents choose the most appropriate tools for each task.

- **Tool Argument Accuracy**  
  Validates the correctness of input parameters provided to tools.

- **Tool Failure Rate**  
  Monitors the frequency of tool failures to identify and address unreliable components.



**Note:**  
Select the metrics that are most relevant to your objectives and use case. Regular evaluation using these metrics will help you build more reliable, efficient, and user-friendly AI agents.
