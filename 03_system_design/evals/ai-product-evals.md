# AI Product Evaluation: Practical Systems for LLM Products (Hamel Husain)
Reference: [Your AI Product Needs Evals](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/)

This summary distills key lessons from Hamel Husain's [Your AI Product Needs Evals](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/) on building robust evaluation systems for LLM-powered products.

---

## 1. Motivation
- Most failed LLM products lack robust evaluation systems.
- Success = ability to iterate quickly: requires evaluation, debugging, and system change (prompting, fine-tuning, code).
- Evaluation is the flywheel for improvement—like tests in software engineering.

---

## 2. The Three Levels of Evaluation

### 2.1 Level 1: Unit Tests
- Assertions (like pytest) for LLM features and scenarios.
- Should be fast, cheap, and run on every code change.
- Use LLMs to help brainstorm assertions and generate synthetic test cases.
- Example: For a real estate assistant, test that queries for listings return the correct number of results.

```python
# Example assertion: No UUIDs in output
const noExposedUUID = message => {
  const sanitizedComment = message.comment.replace(/\{\{.*?\}\}/g, '')
  const regexp = /[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}/ig
  const matches = Array.from(sanitizedComment.matchAll(regexp))
  expect(matches.length, 'Exposed UUIDs').to.equal(0, 'Exposed UUIDs found')
}
```
- Continuously update tests as new failures are observed.
- Track test results over time (e.g., dashboards in Metabase).

### 2.2 Level 2: Human & Model Evaluation
- For things not easily tested by assertions.
- **Log traces** (conversations, actions, etc.) for inspection.
- Build or use tools to view, label, and filter traces (e.g., LangSmith, custom dashboards).
- Human evaluation: label outputs as good/bad, curate data for fine-tuning.
- Model-based eval: Use a strong LLM to critique outputs, align with human judgment via prompt engineering or fine-tuning.
- Track agreement between model and human evals; periodically re-align.
- Use critiques to curate high-quality synthetic data.

### 2.3 Level 3: A/B Testing
- Test if your AI product drives desired user behaviors/outcomes.
- Run only after product is mature enough for real users.
- A/B testing for LLMs is similar to other products.

## 3. Practical Tips for Evaluation
- Remove all friction from looking at data (logs, traces, dashboards).
- Start simple: use existing analytics tools, build lightweight UIs if needed.
- Don't rely solely on generic eval frameworks—tailor evals to your domain and product.
- Write and update lots of tests; use LLMs to help generate and critique data.
- Use your eval infrastructure for debugging and fine-tuning.

---

## 4. Evals Unlock Superpowers
- **Fine-tuning:** Evaluation systems make it easy to curate and synthesize data for fine-tuning.
- **Debugging:** Evaluation infra overlaps with debugging infra—logs, assertions, and trace search help diagnose and fix issues quickly.

---

## 5. Conclusion & Key Takeaways
- Evaluation is the core of successful LLM product development.
- Remove friction, keep it simple, and look at lots of data.
- Use LLMs to bootstrap eval systems (test case generation, critique, labeling).
- Re-use eval infra for debugging and fine-tuning.
