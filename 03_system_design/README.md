# System Design for Agentic AI Systems

This directory provides concise resources for designing, building, and evaluating agentic AI systems. Each subdirectory contains focused guides, patterns, and real-world examples.

## Directory Overview

- **[Architectures](./architectures/):** System blueprints and the [12-Step Agentic System Design](./architectures/ASD-12-step-v1.5.md).
- **[Design Patterns](./design-patterns/):** Patterns and code examples for agentic systems.
- **[Cookbooks](./cookbooks/):** Practical guides and tutorials (e.g., Snowflake, Anthropic).
- **[Agentic AI](./agentic-ai/):** Specialized agentic system design resources.
- **[Layers](./layers/):** Cognitive and reasoning layer designs.
- **[RAGs](./RAGs/README.md):** Retrieval-Augmented Generation architectures and examples (e.g., Uber).
- **[Evals](./evals/):** Agent evaluation frameworks.
- **[Protocols](./protocols/protocols-AI.md):** Communication standards for agentic systems.
- **[Memory](./memory/memory-AI.md):** (Placeholder for future memory system docs)
