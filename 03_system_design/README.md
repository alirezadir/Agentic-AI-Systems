<!-- ## Getting Started

1. **Start with Architectures**: Begin with the 12-step ASD methodology in [architectures/ASD-12-step-v1.5.md](./architectures/ASD-12-step-v1.5.md)
2. **Explore Design Patterns**: Review the design patterns in [design-patterns/](./design-patterns/)
3. **Study Real Examples**: Check out the cookbooks for practical implementation guides
4. **Understand RAG Systems**: Explore the RAGs directory for retrieval-augmented generation patterns
5. **Evaluate Your System**: Use the evaluation frameworks in the evals directory

## Additional Resources

See [SD_resources.md](./SD_resources.md) for curated external resources including:
- Industry guides from Snowflake, Anthropic, and others
- Big company implementations (AWS, Airbnb, Uber, NVIDIA)
- Academic and research papers
- Video tutorials and walkthroughs

## Key Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Design systems with clear separation of concerns
- **Scalability**: Plan for growth and performance at scale
- **Reliability**: Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Security**: Consider safety and security from the ground up
- **Evaluability**: Build systems that can be measured and improved
