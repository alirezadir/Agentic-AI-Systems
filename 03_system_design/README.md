# System Design for Agentic AI Systems

This directory provides concise resources for designing, building, and evaluating agentic AI systems. Each subdirectory contains focused guides, patterns, and real-world examples.

**Latest Updates (2025):**
- Agentic AI design patterns have matured with new enterprise patterns emerging
- Agentic RAG has become the future of RAG systems, enabling dynamic knowledge access
- Evaluation frameworks have standardized with comprehensive benchmarking tools
- New protocols like Model Context Protocol (MCP) enable better tool integration
