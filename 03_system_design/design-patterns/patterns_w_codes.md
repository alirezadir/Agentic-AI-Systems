Not every AI Agents are created equally

Hereâ€™s how to pick the one that fits (with code)...

When you are building an AI Agent,

You must understand design patterns to identify the right one for your needs.

ðŸ“Œ Today we will look at a few of the most popular AI Agent design patterns with code for implementation: 

1. ReACT(Reasoning and Acting):

a. Reasoning: This section builds reasoning by understanding Input and using necessary APIs and memory to build a more contextual understanding.

b. Actions: Actions are the steps taken based on Reasoning.

c. Observation: No matter the type of answer, feedback is provided to the core LLM.

2. Self-Reflection/Reflexion:

a. Core LLM: The core LLM performs simple agentic tasks using tools and memory.

b. Critique LLM: This can be 1 or more LLMs used as a Judge to monitor the main LLM's performance.

c. Change Decision: Another Critique LLM, is responsible for inverting the decision if the output does not match the desired outcome.

3. Agentic RAG:

a. Tool use:-

- Utilizes web-based search as well as vector search protocols to identify the required documents.

- Uses an embedding model to convert the searched information into a vector format.

- Finally, a Hybrid search is utilized using the given prompt to find the right info.

b. Main LLM: The information gathered with tool use is combined with the model's reasoning and memory data to create a desired output.

c. Decision: Finally, the output is shared, and a self-reflection loop is created to consider possible improvements.

4. Meta-Agent

a. Meta-Agent: The core agent commands other sub-agents with tool calling + Memory abilities.

b. Sub-Agents: These are specialized agents with their specific tools for specific tasks.

c. Combined decision: The sub-agents receive a combined response and input guidance to align the output.

d. Output summarization: Output feedback is given to the Meta-Agent to learn from the current output and to adjust sub-agent performance.
