## Step 1: Problem Formulation 
### 1.1 Define the System Goal & Scope

🎯 Objective

We start by establishing **why** the system exists and **what** it must achieve.

Example Use Cases:
- A. Customer Support Agent
Handles queries using RAG + tool calls (e.g., refunds, tracking, updates)
B. Personal Productivity Agent
Manages tasks, calendars, notes, reminders across tools
C. Simulation NPC Agent
Used in a game, behaves with memory, planning, and dialogue
D. Domain-Specific Agent
e.g., Legal assistant, Healthcare triage assistant, Code reviewer
E. Agentic Backend for LLM SaaS
Allows devs to plug in reasoning + actions with memory


Example Use Case: Customer Support Agent


Build a customer-facing LLM agent that:
	•	Answers queries using documentation and knowledge bases
	•	Performs actions like refunds or order tracking via APIs
	•	Adapts to user history and preferences
	•	Escalates gracefully to human agents
	•	Learns and improves over time

✅ Key Questions

- What is the agent expected to do?
Is it a task planner, code assistant, gaming NPC, customer support agent, etc.?
- Who are the users?
Internal developers, end-users, customers, or other systems?
- What is the interaction mode?
Text, voice, multimodal UI, or via APIs?
- What is the latency requirement?
Real-time (e.g., voice), interactive (e.g., chat), or batch (e.g., data processing)?
- What type of intelligence is expected?
Rule-based logic, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or tool-augmented autonomous reasoning?

Example:

## Step 4: Data Modeling & Prompt Interface Design

### 4.1  Core Data Models
🎯 Primary Entities
Entity
Attributes
Source
User
user_id, name, email, language, permissions, history[]
Auth system, CRM
Order
order_id, status, items[], tracking_url, refund_eligible
Order API
Product/Service
product_id, description, warranty, faq[]
Knowledge base
Session Context
session_id, user_id, messages[], tools_used[], summary
Memory Layer
Interaction Log
timestamp, input, retrieved_docs, tool_calls[], output

### 4.2. Prompt Interface Design

A modular prompt structure is critical for consistent, contextual agent behavior.

🧱 Prompt Template Structure

[System Instructions]
You are a helpful AI agent assisting users.

[User Context]
Name: {{user.name}}
Language: {{user.language}}

[Current Question]
{{user_input}}

[Memory / Retrieved Docs]
{{retrieved_snippets}}

[Expected Format]
Clear, actionable response

🔧 Tool-Calling Prompt Interface

{
  "tool_call": {
    "tool": "OrderLookup",
    "params": {
      "order_id": "123456"
    }
  }
}

### 4.3 Tool Use Protocol (Optional Format)

In multi-tool environments, prompt structure must also embed tool call hints.

### 4.4 🧠 Design Patterns at this Layer
•	Prompt Chaining: Sequential reasoning and formatting layers.
•	ReAct Pattern: Reasoning followed by tool action.
•	CodeAct Pattern: Embed tool APIs directly in prompts.

⸻

## Step 5: Memory Strategy & Feedback Loops

5.1. Why Memory Matters in Customer Support

An effective support agent needs situational awareness:
	•	What was asked before?
	•	What tools were used?
	•	What did the user like/dislike?
	•	What is known about this user historically?

Without memory, the agent feels robotic. With well-designed memory, it feels context-aware, adaptive, and human-aligned.

5.2 Context Window Strategy
Context Type
Injection Approach
Triggers
Short-Term Memory
Token window + sliding buffer
Chat session
Long-Term Memory
Summarized and inserted
Start of session
RAG Retrieval
Top-k semantic chunks
For factual queries
Tool Results
Appended or summarized inline
On tool completion


🧠 Memory Layers

Type	Description	Tools
Short-term	In-session recall	Redis, BufferMemory
Long-term	Cross-session summary, preferences	Zep, MongoDB

🔁 Memory Ingestion Flow

Transcript ➝ GPT Summary ➝ Store in Zep/Supabase ➝ Retrieve per session/init

### 6. Feedback Loop Design

✅ Feedback Collection

Type	Channel
User Feedback	Thumbs up/down, edits
LLM Scoring	GPT eval, Opik pipeline

🔁 Real-time Feedback
Method
Action
👍 / 👎
Store interaction result in feedback DB
“Not helpful”
Tag and escalate to human
Edit Response
Capture correction for LLM fine-tuning

🔁 Feedback Loop

Feedback ➝ Eval Tag ➝ Prompt/Memory Update ➝ Improved Behavior

🧠 Design Patterns at this Layer
	•	Self-Reflection: Analyze and revise outputs internally.
	•	Reflexion Loop: Re-evaluate failed outputs using memory.
	•	Evaluator Optimizer: Score outputs and re-route.

🧠 LLM Evaluation

Use automated scoring (e.g., GPT-4) for:
	•	Answer quality
	•	Factual accuracy
	•	Politeness / tone
	•	Tool success or failure

Store this evaluation metadata for:
	•	Dashboard analytics
	•	Long-term tuning
	•	Prompt updates or model reranking
⸻

## Step 6: Tooling Integration + Action Framework
Language alone isn’t enough — agentic AI systems must act:
	•	Fetch order status
	•	Trigger refunds
	•	Update user profiles
	•	Escalate to humans

Tools extend LLMs from “smart talkers” into interactive systems that can change the world (or a database, at least).

2. Tool Types by Use Case

Tool Type
Example Function
Real World API Source
Read-Only
Order lookup, product info
CRM, e-commerce API
Transactional
Initiate refund, cancel order
Payments or ERP system
Data Generation
Fetch summaries, create tickets
Notion, Jira, Slack, etc.
Fallback Search
External search (FAQs, web docs)
Serper.dev, Exa, Bing API

🔧 Tool Types

Type	Example
Lookup	Track Order API
Transaction	Refund API
Escalation	Route to Human Agent

3. Tool Call Protocol (LLM-Aware Format)

Tools must be defined in a structured, model-readable way.

4. Agent-to-Tool Flow
[Prompt] → [LLM generates tool_call JSON] → [Tool Router executes API] 
→ [Result returned] → [LLM generates final response using result]
If the LLM is uncertain:
	•	It can reflect (“Do I need a tool?”)
	•	Or ask user for clarification before action

5. Tool Execution Engine (Router)
Handles:
	•	JSON validation
	•	Auth tokens (OAuth, API keys)
	•	Rate limiting
	•	Retry/backoff on failure

⚙️ Tool Router Flow

LLM ➝ JSON Tool Call ➝ Router ➝ API ➝ Result ➝ Injected in Prompt ➝ Response

🧰 Tool Execution Platform
	•	LangChain ToolExecutor
	•	Custom FastAPI tool server
	•	Observability via Langfuse traces

🧠 Design Patterns at this Layer
	•	Tool Use Pattern: Encapsulate tool use with error handling.
	•	CodeAct Pattern: Translate LLM output into structured tool calls.
6. Tool Call Triggers

7. Tool Output Injection Strategies

8. Error & Safety Handling

9. Security & Observability for Tools

## Step 7: Observability, Evaluation & Continuous Improvement

📊 What to Measure

Metric Type	Example
Latency	Time per LLM+tool round
Accuracy	Match to ground truth or eval score
Feedback	Thumb ratio, correction count
Tool Success	Failures, retries, latency

	•	Reflexion Loop: Improves system based on performance feedback.


## ✅ Step 7: Observability, Evaluation & Continuous Improvement

Use Case: Customer Support Agent (Agentic AI System)

⸻

1. Why Observability Matters

An agent is never “done” — it must be monitored, evaluated, and refined continuously.

Without observability, you’re:
	•	Flying blind during failures
	•	Missing edge cases
	•	Blind to user frustration
	•	Unable to improve model behavior

⸻

2. What to Monitor

Category	Metrics / Signals
Prompt Lifecycle	Token count, latency, tool calls triggered
LLM Responses	Accuracy, hallucination rate, format validity
Tool Usage	Success rate, latency, error codes
User Feedback	Thumbs up/down, edits, rephrasings
Memory Access	Retrieval hit/miss rate, summary size
Escalations	When agents hand off to humans


⸻

3. Key Tools & Frameworks

Layer	Tools / Services
Logging & Tracing	Langfuse, Helicone, OpenTelemetry
Prompt/Tool Logs	Custom logging middleware (LangChain/LCEL)
LLM Evaluation	Opik, GPT-as-a-judge, custom grading tools
Error Alerting	Prometheus + Grafana, Sentry, PagerDuty


⸻

4. Evaluation Types

📌 Automated Evaluation

Metric	Method
Factuality	GPT-4 graded on factual correctness
Relevance	Compare question → response relevance score
Politeness	Classifier or LLM detects tone issues
Latency	Measure roundtrip response time


⸻

🧠 Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation
	•	Review edge cases
	•	Tag failure reasons (wrong tool, bad memory, hallucination, etc.)
	•	Feed back into:
	•	Prompt tuning
	•	Tool fix/update
	•	Model selection refinement

⸻

5. Feedback Loop Integration

[User Feedback / LLM Grading]
    ↓
[Log to Feedback DB]
    ↓
[Tag: good / needs improvement / escalation]
    ↓
→ Prompt Library Update
→ Tool Decision Rule Update
→ LLM Ranking Tuning
→ Memory Injection Fix


⸻

6. Versioning & Rollouts

Layer	Version Control Needed
Prompt Templates	Git-tracked or hash-versioned
Tools & APIs	Schema + endpoint versioning
LLM Selection	Use A/B testing + traffic split
Memory Format	Schema evolution via migration

Tip: Use feature flags to test new flows safely.

⸻

7. Failure Mode Analysis

Mode	Example	Mitigation
Hallucination	“We refunded it” (but didn’t)	Guardrail prompts + tool use only
Tool fails silently	Timeout during refund call	Add retries, confirm via status
Wrong context injected	Wrong user summary used	Add memory hash validation
Looping responses	Agent keeps re-answering same way	Conversation turn limit + fallback


⸻

8. Continuous Improvement Strategy

Area	Update Method
Prompts	Weekly review, auto-tune w/ eval data
Tools	Improve APIs, better error handling
LLM Choice	Retrain, fine-tune, or swap providers
Memory Strategy	Tune summarization + injection methods
Escalation Logic	Add rules based on recurring fail tags


⸻

✅ Summary of Step 7

You now have:
	•	A complete observability stack
	•	Evaluation strategies using LLM + human grading
	•	Feedback loops for improving prompts, tools, and memory
	•	A rollout/versioning strategy for safe iteration

⸻
