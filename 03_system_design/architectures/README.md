# Agentic AI Architectures

**Updated 2025**: This page provides a comprehensive overview of architectures in agentic AI systems, including architecture layers, step-by-step system design, and example architectures used by tech companies.

**2025 Context**: Architecture patterns have matured significantly, with standardized approaches for production systems, new enterprise patterns, and comprehensive design methodologies. The 12-Step Agentic System Design framework provides a systematic approach to building production-ready agentic AI systems.
