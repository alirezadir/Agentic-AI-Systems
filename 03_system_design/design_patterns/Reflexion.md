If your AI agent isnâ€™t learning, itâ€™s failing.

ReAct stops at thinkingâ€”Reflexion remembers, here's what i mean

When you are building a powerful reasoning Agent

You need your agents to remember the past mistakes,

This makes your agent more aware while creating a new response.

One major way to do it was ReACT(Reasoning + Acting), not any more!

ReAct thinks step by step, once the task is done, it doesnâ€™t remember past mistakes.

This is where Reflexion comes into play,

How, lets me break it down:

1. User Query â†’ The user provides an input/query to the Agent.

2. Actor/Responder (LLM) â†’ It produces an initial response using short-term memory and available tools.
- Short-term memory: Stores information about current interactions between the agent and the user.

3. Response Evaluation â†’ The generated response is passed to the Evaluator/Revisor (LLM) for quality assessment.

4. Evaluator/Revisor (LLM) â†’ Creates an improved response by taking feedback from past mistakes through long-term memory.
- Sends a copy of the initial response along with the improved response to Self-reflection (LLM)

5. Self-reflection (LLM) - This model creates detailed info regarding mistakes and improvements by comparing both responses.
- It then sends the details regarding improvements to long-term memory.

6. If improvement is needed from the current context or additional tool support, the Evaluator sends it back to the actor.
- This cycle continues until the Evalutor builds a good reasoned output for the user.

ðŸ“ŒTo sum it up:

Evaluator LLM and Self-reflection LLM along with the smart use of Short and Long-term memory, 

There that's how you build reinforcement via Self-Reflection in AI Agents.

However, you can also implement the same strategy on ReACT to build an even more advanced reasoning pattern.

ðŸ“Œ Note:

This is a rather simplified version of the actual Reflexion pattern, 

if want to learn an in-depth version of this, you can check out the paper linked in the comments.

ðŸ“Œ Little Bonus:

The Reflexion design pattern is also one of the few advanced design patterns supported even by Langchain.
