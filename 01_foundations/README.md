# Foundations of Gen AI & Agentic AI Systems

<!-- - [ ] Todo: add readmes + update contents
- [ ] Todo: add foundations from Gen-AI Interviews -->

This section provides core concepts and foundational knowledge for Gen-AI systems, Agents, and agentic AI systems. 

### Contents:
#### 1. Gen AI
- [AI Engineering Summary](./ai-engineering-summary/README.md): chapter-wise summary of the  [**AI Engineering** book by Chip Huyen](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-engineering/9781098166298/)
- [LLMs](./llms/): LLM training workflows, LLM frameworks comparison, and LLM architecture (trasnformers variants.)
- [Gen-AI](./gen-AI/): Technical architecture and evaluation frameworks
#### 2. Agents
- [Agents](./agents/README.md): Agents and agentic AI systems definitions and evolution
#### 3. AI coding
- [Modern Python](./python/): Best practices and optimization in modern Python & vibe coding
<!-- - [`assets/`](./assets/): Visual resources and diagrams -->

<!-- ## Key Areas

1. **AI Engineering**

<!-- 
## Learning Path

1. Start with `ai-engineering-summary/` for concepts
2. Move to `gen-AI/` for architecture
3. Explore `agents/` for implementation
4. Study `llms/` for model integration
5. Review `python/` for best practices -->
