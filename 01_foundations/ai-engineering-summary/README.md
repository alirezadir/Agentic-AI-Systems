# AI Engineering Book Summary

This is my personal summary of key concepts and chapters from the book [**AI Engineering** book by Chip Huyen](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-engineering/9781098166298/). Each chapter distills core insights, practical notes, and system design principles relevant to building real-world ML and agentic systems.

##  Why This Summary?

- To consolidate modern AI engineering practices for reference and application.
- To bridge theory and hands-on implementation for GenAI, agentic systems, and full-stack ML platforms.
- To complement the [Agentic-AI-Systems](../README.md) repo with a strong theoretical foundation.
