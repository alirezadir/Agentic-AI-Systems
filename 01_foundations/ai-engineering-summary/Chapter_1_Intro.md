## 1. The Rise of AI Engineering

### Key Concepts:
- **AI Engineering**: The practice of building AI-powered applications using pre-trained models (esp. foundation models).
- **Model-as-a-Service (MaaS)**: Provides access to models like GPT-4, Claude, Gemini via APIs—no need to train from scratch.
- **Foundation Models**: General-purpose models trained on massive data (text, images, code, etc.), enabling many downstream tasks.

### Practical Takeaways:
- Pretrained models reduce time-to-market for AI apps.
- The barrier to entry is now about **prompting + integration**, not model training.

<!-- ### Interview Tips:
- Expect system design questions around "How would you use a foundation model to build X?"
- Emphasize API orchestration, not just model accuracy. -->

## 2. From Language Models → Large Language Models → Foundation Models

### Key Evolutions:
| Generation | Core Idea           | Training Method          |
|------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| LM         | Predict next token  | Supervised learning       |
| LLM        | Scale to billions   | Self-supervised learning  |
| FM         | Multimodal, general | Pretrained on mixed media |

### Technical Notes:
- **Self-supervision**: Learning by predicting missing parts of input (e.g., masked words).
- **Scaling laws**: More data + compute = better generalization.

## 3. From Foundation Models to AI Engineering

### Core Principles:
- **Product First**: Start with the app, not the model.
- **API Assembly**: Use LangChain, FastAPI, OpenAI APIs, HuggingFace pipelines.
- **Evaluation-Driven Dev**: Logs, feedback loops, prompt/version tracking.

### Interview Scenario:
> "Design a GenAI app for onboarding new employees using existing models."

### Pro Tip:
Understand the **AI Stack**: Prompting → Retrieval → Model inference → Output formatting → Logging.

## 5. Planning AI Applications

### Key Frameworks:
- **Use Case Evaluation**:
  - Should this use case be automated?
  - Is the task well-defined or open-ended?
- **Milestone Planning**:
  - P0: Working MVP with API
  - P1: Add logging, version control
  - P2: Feedback loop + evaluation

### Common Mistakes:
- Skipping human-in-the-loop checks.
- No clear fallback for model failure cases.

## ✅ Review Questions

**1. What is AI engineering?**  
> The discipline of building applications using foundation models (like GPT, Claude), focusing on prompting, integration, and feedback rather than training.

**2. How did foundation models evolve from LLMs?**  
> LLMs use self-supervised training; FMs add multimodal input, broader capabilities, and are reused across tasks.

**3. What makes AI engineering different from ML engineering?**  
> AI engineers use models-as-APIs and optimize UX + reliability, not training pipelines.

**4. Why is evaluation more important with FMs?**  
> Output varies with prompt/version; logging and dynamic evaluation are essential.

## 💻 Code Examples

### ✅ Foundation Model API

```python
from openai import OpenAI

response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize my meeting notes."}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

<!-- ### ✅ Use Case Fit Helper

```python
def is_good_use_case_for_genai(task):
    keywords = ["summarize", "generate", "transform", "chat"]
    return any(k in task.lower() for k in keywords)
