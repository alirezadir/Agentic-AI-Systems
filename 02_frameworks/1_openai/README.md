# OpenAI Agents


### Overview:
This directory contains comprehensive documentation, guides, tutorials, and code examples for building AI agents using the OpenAI API and Agents SDK. It provides everything you need—including starter code—to help you get started quickly.



### Contents:
#### 1. Documents
- [OpenAI Agents (Concepts and Setup)](./docs/openai_agents_overview.md): Key concepts and basic setup for OpenAI agentic systems.
- [OpenAI Agents SDK (Comprehensive Guide)](./docs/openai_agents_sdk.md): Comprehensive guide and code examples for building agents with the OpenAI Agents SDK.
- [OpenAI API Quickstart](./docs/openai_api_quickstart.md): Fast start guide for using the OpenAI API for generative tasks.
- [OpenAI Agents Design Guide (Summary)](./docs/openai-agents-design-guide.md): Design principles and structure for OpenAI agents.

#### 2. Code
- Comprehensive starter codes for building agents with the OpenAI Agents SDK can be found in the [code](./code/README.md) including: 
    - Agents basics, 
    - models, 
    - tools, 
    - context, 
    - handoffs, 
    - guardrails, 
    - streaming, 
    - lifecycle, 
    - outputs, 
    - tracing, 
    - mcp, 
    - prompting, 
    - and voice_agents.
