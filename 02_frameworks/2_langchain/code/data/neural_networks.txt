Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks in human brains. They are a fundamental component of deep learning systems.

Key Components:
1. Neurons: Basic processing units
2. Layers: Input, hidden, and output layers
3. Weights: Connection strengths between neurons
4. Activation Functions: Non-linear transformations

Types of Neural Networks:
- Feedforward Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks
- Transformer Networks

Applications:
- Image Recognition
- Natural Language Processing
- Speech Recognition
- Time Series Prediction
- Game Playing

Training Process:
1. Forward Propagation
2. Loss Calculation
3. Backpropagation
4. Weight Updates
