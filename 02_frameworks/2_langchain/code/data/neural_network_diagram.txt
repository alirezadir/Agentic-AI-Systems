Neural Network Architecture Diagram Description:

This diagram shows a simple feedforward neural network with:
- Input Layer: 3 neurons (circles) representing input features
- Hidden Layer: 4 neurons with activation functions
- Output Layer: 2 neurons for classification
- Connections: Weighted lines between neurons showing the flow of information
- Activation: Sigmoid functions shown as curved lines in the hidden layer

The diagram illustrates how data flows from left to right through the network, with each layer transforming the input through weighted connections and activation functions.
