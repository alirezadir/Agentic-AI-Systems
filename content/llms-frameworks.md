## LLMs
### üîç LLM Model Selection 

Source: [Panaverse ‚Äì Which LLM](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai/tree/main/-01_lets_get_started/00_which_llm)

## üìå LLM Selection Criteria

When choosing a Large Language Model (LLM) for agentic AI applications, consider the following:

- **Performance** ‚Äì Accuracy and reliability in output.
- **Cost** ‚Äì Token pricing and operational expense.
- **Latency** ‚Äì Response speed for interactive use.
- **Context Window** ‚Äì How much input the model can handle.
- **Customization** ‚Äì Support for fine-tuning and task adaptation.
- **Licensing** ‚Äì Open-source availability and usage restrictions.

## üèÜ Recommended LLMs by Use Case

| **Use Case**                    | **Recommended LLM** | **Why**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| General-purpose applications     | **OpenAI GPT-4**     | High performance and broad task coverage                               |
| Cost-sensitive projects          | **Mistral**          | Affordable with strong capabilities                                     |
| Open-source required             | **Meta LLaMA**       | Open license and active community                                       |
| Multimodal input (text + image)  | **Google Gemini**    | Designed for handling diverse data types                                |
| Compliance and safety focus      | **Anthropic Claude** | Prioritizes alignment, ethical reasoning, and safer outputs             |

Choose your LLM based on **your project's needs**: balance **cost, speed, licensing, and capabilities**. For most general use, **GPT-4** remains top-tier. For open-source or budget-friendly setups, **LLaMA** or **Mistral** are strong contenders.

<!-- | Framework           | Summary                                                                                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OpenAI Agents SDK   | Very simple and flexible. Easy to learn. Gives you direct control with minimal abstraction. Best for Python developers. |
| CrewAI              | Focuses on teamwork between agents. Slightly more complex but still accessible. Balances simplicity and control. |
| AutoGen             | Designed for conversation-based agents. Medium learning curve, good for interactive and human-involved tasks. |
| Google ADK          | Google Cloud-based with strong tooling. Supports complex agent setups. Moderate learning effort, slightly higher control. |
| LangGraph           | Uses graphs to define workflows. Very powerful but complex and harder to learn. Requires explicit state control. | -->
<!-- | Dapr Agents         | Event-driven and cloud-native. Good for resilient, distributed systems. Medium complexity, designed for scalable deployments. | -->

- MCP (Model Context Protocol): MCP is a protocol that manages the context and state of the LLM during interactions (resources, tools, memory, role, goals, etc.).
- A2A: Agent-to-Agent communication protocol (from, to, type, content, etc.)


- AI agents will replace SaaS and traditional SW apps.
- vertical agents (e.g., for finance, healthcare, etc.) will be more common than general-purpose (horizontal) agents.
