# System Design Document: Scalable AI Agent Architecture

## Objective
Design a modular and scalable architecture for AI agents that can reason, interact with external tools, and operate as single or multi-agent systems.

---

## High-Level Architecture Modules

### 1. Language Model Layer (LLM Selection)

**Responsibilities:**
- Core reasoning and language understanding
- Follows logical chains of thought
- Ensures output stability and accuracy

**Design Decisions:**
- Choose LLMs based on reasoning depth, response consistency, and licensing
- Prefer models supporting Chain-of-Thought prompting

**Best Practices:**
- Use open-weight LLMs like LLaMA, Mistral, Claude Opus for flexibility and control

---

### 2. Cognitive Logic Engine

**Responsibilities:**
- Encodes agent "thinking" patterns
- Controls behavior like reflection, planning, and tool invocation

**Design Decisions:**
- Use frameworks like **ReAct**, **Plan-then-Execute** to manage step-based or event-based decisions

**Best Practices:**
- Keep logic templates modular and extensible
- Enable fallback logic when plan execution fails

---

### 3. Instruction Framework

**Responsibilities:**
- Provides operating instructions to the agent
- Defines response format, tool triggers, and behavior control

**Design Decisions:**
- Use structured prompt templates
- Allow instruction injection at runtime for customization

**Best Practices:**
- Modularize instructions into templates (e.g., JSON output, Markdown formatting)
- Store and reuse instruction sets for different agents/tasks

---

### 4. Memory Subsystem

**Responsibilities:**
- Provide short-term and long-term context awareness
- Allow agents to remember previous interactions, decisions, and preferences

**Design Decisions:**
- Implement a **sliding window** mechanism for recent token context
- Integrate persistent stores (e.g., Redis, Postgres, or vector DBs)

**Best Practices:**
- Use summarization for long sessions
- Persist facts and user preferences in vector or key-value stores
- Tools: MemGPT, ZepAI

---

### 5. Tooling and API Integration Layer

**Responsibilities:**
- Allow agents to perform actions beyond text generation
- Handle external data access, computations, or transactional operations

**Design Decisions:**
- Abstract each tool with a function interface (e.g., search_db, call_crm)
- Ensure secure and authenticated access

**Best Practices:**
- Document tool schemas and error handling
- Delay tool invocation until absolutely necessary

---

### 6. Task Management Module

**Responsibilities:**
- Assign clear, bounded goals to agents
- Prevent hallucination by narrowing scope

**Design Decisions:**
- Use domain-specific task templates
- Implement validation layers for task completion

**Best Practices:**
- Phrase goals with specific intents and constraints
  - Prefer: “Summarize feedback and suggest improvements”
  - Avoid: “Be helpful”

---

### 7. Multi-Agent Coordination Layer

**Responsibilities:**
- Enable task decomposition across specialized agents
- Coordinate messaging, task flow, and handoffs

**Design Decisions:**
- Use agent roles with clear input/output contracts
- Example roles: DataGatherer → Analyst → Presenter

**Best Practices:**
- Use task-specific agent naming for traceability
- Implement inter-agent communication via shared memory or pub/sub

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

| Concern             | Strategy                                                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Security**         | Token and permission control for tools/APIs                             |
| **Observability**    | Logging agent decisions, tool calls, and user feedback                  |
| **Versioning**       | Track instruction versions, model changes, memory updates               |
| **Scalability**      | Modular components; deploy agents as containers/functions               |
| **Adaptability**     | Hot-swappable logic, tool configs, and model selection via flags        |

## Conclusion

This modular framework allows developers to build, test, and scale intelligent agents with clearly defined behaviors, memory, tooling, and task flows. It supports both **single-agent** and **multi-agent** use cases with a focus on control, observability, and performance.
