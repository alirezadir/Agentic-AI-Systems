## 3. Agent Runtime & Orchestration

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Parse user intent
  - Select appropriate tools or agents
  - Manage reasoning and execution flow

---

## 4. Tooling Framework (Function Tools)

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Integrate function-calling tools like:
    - Calendar
    - Task Manager
    - Preference Engine
- **Input Sources:**
  - UI/UX Layer (chat, voice, goal-based prompts)

## 5. Guardrails (Input/Output Validation)

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Apply safety and policy filters
  - Check for overload, task limits, and constraints

---

## 6. Language Model Inference (LLM)

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Generate decisions, responses, and summaries
  - Powered by LLMs like GPT or Claude for reasoning

---

## 7. Business Logic / API Services

- **Responsibilities:**

## 9. Feedback Collection

- **Mechanisms:**
  - Thumbs up/down
  - Edit suggestions or corrections

---

## 10. Learning / Memory Update Loop

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Update long-term memory based on feedback and context
  - Adapt future agent responses accordingly

---

## 11. Async Processing / Background Tasks

- **Examples:**
  - Reschedule meetings
  - Send emails
  - Fetch external data via APIs
